# Kageshi Browser Extension

The means to inflict our will upon the helpless HTML and Javascripts

## Current Status

It works. It works by injecting a script tag into the head with the current
shim.

## The Future

I intend to publish this as a Beta add-on, but I started drinking immediately
prior to figuring it out. From there, I can imagine many things when I'm sober.

## HOWTO

Clone repository.

In Firefox go to about:debugging and then This Firefox.
Load Temporary Add-On, then point at any file in the folder.
Shazam. It works.


## TODO

Documentation!
