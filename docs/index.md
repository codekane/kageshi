# Kageshit Browser Extension

Are you annoyed at the buggy state of the new Ezcapechat?  
Are you perhaps a fan of what copy/pasting into a console can give you, but far
too lazy?  
Are you looking for a better way?

It's here. The new Kageshit Browser Extension.

[Version 0.1](https://fried-possum-peckers.github.io/kageshit/release/kageshit-0.1.xpi) -- Firefox Only
