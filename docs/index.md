# Kageshit Browser Extension

Are you annoyed at the buggy state of the new Ezcapechat?  
Are you perhaps a fan of what copy/pasting into a console can give you, but far
too lazy?  
Are you looking for a better way?

It's here. The new Kageshit Browser Extension.

[Version 0.1 Firefox](https://fried-possum-peckers.github.io/kageshit/release/kageshit-0.1.xpi)
[Version 0.1
Chrome](https://fried-possum-peckers.github.io/kageshit/release/kageshit-chrome-0.1.zip)

## Installation Instructions
Firefox:
>> Install the .xpi file

Chrome:
>> Download the .zip file
>> Unzip the .zip file
>> Go to chrome://extensions/
>> Check box for Developer mode
>> Load unpacked
>> Navigate to and select the folder you unzipped the .zip file into
>> Press Select


#### Updates
Firefox should in -theory- (untested as this is V0.1) receive automatic updates.
Chrome is a bag of ugly farts and won't let me set things like that up for the
beta, unless I release it on the app store. I looked into it, and the code is
such a mangled mess I HIGHLY DOUBT it would be approved on the app store. So. It
works, but you'll need to remove the old version, and follow the instructions
above when(if) new versions are released.

## Usage Instructions
Automagically will fix imgUR links being broken. It's the single most important
thing.  

Also includes a fancy SoundCloud Player.  
>> !sc_add  URL  
>> !sc_remove URL  

The player will work for anyone with the extension installed.  

Nifty, right?
