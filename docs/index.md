# Kageshit Browser Extension

It's here. The new Kageshit Firefox Extension.

[Version 0.2 Firefox](https://codekane.github.io/kageshit/release/kageshit-0.2.xpi)  

## Installation Instructions
>> Install the .xpi file

## Release Notes
- SoundCloud is temporarily disabled, while I work out the kinks, and
    reverse-engineer the code. It'll be back.
- Tab completion is now working wonderfully, thanks to dongfix.
- No more copy/pasting Imgur links. Hurray!
- Removes that stupid message that shows up when you join, and haven't typed
    anything yet, or you try to PM someone.


Development is by no means concluded. The feature list her is decidedly
incomplete. For once in our history, we're pulling together all of our work, to
share with you all, our friends.

This is Version 0.2 for Firefox. Version 0.1 broke when Github stopped serving
our Gists.

Work is ongoing on all ends to port over all features from all versions to all
browsers. Please be patient.

I love you all.

Sincerely,  
Scald
